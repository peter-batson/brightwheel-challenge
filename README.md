# Brightwheel Code Challenge

Welcome to your one stop shop for visibility into the most popular Github repos!

To get started all you need to do is run `npm start` after you clone down the repository

You should see a carded list of the top 100 starred Github repositories. If not, the gremlins are in your machine.

Are you curious about the repo's most recent commit history? Of course you are!

If you want to know what has been changed, just click on the repo's card and you'll be show a comprehensive list of the commits from the past 24 hours.

Don't see any commits? Don't worry! It's not the gremlins this time, it's those slacker developers mantaining these projects. You should send them an email or something.

## Future Planned Features

I'd like to incorporate a few additional features here. One would be a test suite, just to make sure the code is doing what we want it to. Also, I'd want a designer to take a closer look
and make this prettier. Full transparency, designers design better than I do. I think it'd also be cool to have a toggle that says how far back you want to look for commits. The default
would still be 24 hours, but it might be nice to go back 48 hours, 2 weeks, etc. It could also be fun to have the ability to link to repos from the repo page, and maybe even get the https 
clone link, that way if you want it locally, you don't even need to leave the app!



Anywho, this was a fun project to work on, and I hope I go to talk to you about it and all the things I learned!

Cheers!
