# Brightwheel Code Challenge

Welcome to your one stop shop for visibility into the most popular Github repos!

To get started all you need to do is run `npm start` after you clone down the repository

You should see a carded list of the top 100 starred Github repositories. If not, the gremlins are in your machine.

Are you curious about the repo's most recent commit history? Of course you are!

If you want to know what has been changed in the last 24 hours, just click on the repo's card and you'll be show a comprehensive list of the commits from the past 24 hours?

Don't see any commits? Don't worry! It's not the gremlins, it's those slacker developers mantaining these projects. You should send them an email or something.

Anywho, this was a fun project to work on, and I hope I go to talk to you about it and all the things I learned!

Cheers!
